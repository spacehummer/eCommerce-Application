## Description

This project is a solution to the task [eCommerce Application](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/eCommerce-Application/Readme.md) for the JavaScript/Front-end course of the <a href="https://rs.school/js/">RSSchool</a>.
This solution is a platform that brings together people who want to buy new or sell books that they no longer need. On this platform, you can buy books and related products from the list of available ones. Also post your books for sale.

## Purpose

**BookSavior** - is a service for preserving cultural heritage in its original form. We believe that it is important to give books a second life. That's why we accept any books and printed publications from people who no longer need them and give people who are looking for a particular book the opportunity to finally get it into their library.
